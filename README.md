## Development

### Changesets
If you are contributing a user-facing or noteworthy change that should be added to the changelog, you should include a changeset with your PR by running the following command:

```console
npx changeset add
```

Follow the prompts to specify whether the change is a major, minor or patch change. This will create a file in the `.changesets` directory of the repo. This change should be committed and included with your PR.

### Release Steps

Whenever a new changeset is merged to the "main" branch, the `release` workflow will open a PR (or append to the existing PR if one is already open) with the all of the pending changesets.

Publishing a release simply requires that you approve/merge this PR. This will trigger the publishing of the package to the npm registry and the creation of the GitHub release.
